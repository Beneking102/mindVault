This is an project im currently working on (so its in progress).
Im trying to learn C# and .NET so thats why im doing my own "MindVault". That is some kind of "MS Obsidian" but just selfmade :D

Feel free to fork or do whatever with this code.

It currently already has an working Swagger UI where u can create Accounts for the Auth and make your own Notes.
Just need to create ur Docker (i will add Instructions soon)
